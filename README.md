Material Weight Calculator Web Application
This project provides a web-based calculator to determine the weight of materials based on their density and dimensions. The application allows users to input the density, length, width, and height of a material, and calculates its weight. It also provides access to a list of common material densities, with a link to view a more comprehensive list.

Features
Material Weight Calculation: Enter the density, length, width, and height to calculate the weight of a material.
Density Table: View a table of common material densities (e.g., Steel, Aluminum, Concrete).
External Resource Link: Access a comprehensive list of material densities across the world via an external link.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices with a modern, high-end UI.
Unit Conversion: Support for both meters (m) and millimeters (mm) as units for input dimensions.
Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core: Backend framework for the web API.
Razor Pages: For creating the front-end web pages.
JavaScript (ES6): For client-side functionality such as calculations.
CSS: Custom styles for the UI with a high-end design color scheme.
Bootstrap: Used for responsive design and layout components.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 6.0 SDK
Node.js (for managing frontend dependencies if needed)
Git (for version control)
Steps to Run the Application
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/PSivaMallikarjun/WeighzCal
Open in Visual Studio:

Open the project folder in Visual Studio 2022.
Restore the dependencies using the built-in tools in Visual Studio.
Run the Application:

Press Ctrl + F5 to run the application without debugging.
The app should open in your default web browser at  (or the port defined in the launchSettings.json).
Browse the Application:

Navigate through the form to enter the material density and dimensions and calculate the weight.
Additional Configuration
If you wish to change the application URL or configure authentication, update the launchSettings.json file located in the Properties folder of the project.
For production deployment, consider configuring an appropriate web server like IIS or a cloud hosting platform.
How to Use
Enter Material Information:

Fill in the Density (kg/mÂ³), Length (m), Width (m), and Height (m) in the form.
Select the unit of measurement (meters or millimeters).
Click Calculate Weight to see the result.
View Material Densities:

Click View Common Densities to see a list of common material densities (Steel, Aluminum, Concrete, etc.).
For a full list, click the View Complete Material Densities button to access the external resource.
Output:

The weight of the material will be calculated and displayed in kilograms (kg).
Conversion between meters and millimeters is also supported for more precise inputs.
